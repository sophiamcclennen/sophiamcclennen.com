Professor Sophia McClennen [discusses her new book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B4eFfkpvuo), Pranksters vs. Autocrats, and what her findings reveal about the effectiveness of protest movements. She explains protest tactics such as dilemma actions and "laughtivism." This book was a collaboration between Dr. McClennen and nonviolent activist Srdja Popovic.
