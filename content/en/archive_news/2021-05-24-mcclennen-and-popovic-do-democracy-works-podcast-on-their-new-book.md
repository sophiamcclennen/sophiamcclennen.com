At a time when democracy is in retreat around the world, it can be difficult to find the motivation to keep movements going. Our guests this week offer a framework for effective nonviolent organizing by trapping authority figures between a rock and a hard place.

Srjda Popovic and Sophia A. McClennen have appeared on Democracy Works separately and are now joining forces to apply a research framework to dilemma actions, a nonviolent organizing tactic that works by capitalizing on a belief thatâ€™s commonly held by the public but not supported by those in power.
