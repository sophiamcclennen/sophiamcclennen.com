McClennen spoke at the North Eastern Modern Language Association on her recent book on Latin American Cinema and globalization. Her talk offered an overview of a 25-year interdisciplinary project that used the case study of Latin American Cinema to offer a revised critical paradigm for how we understand the effects of globalization on cultural production. It offered insights into how to effectively use empirical research methods, interdisciplinary approaches and humanistic perspectives to offer concrete and meaningful theories about culture and power.
