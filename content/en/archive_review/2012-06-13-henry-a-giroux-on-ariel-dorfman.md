'"Sophia A. McClennen is a writer of extraordinary gifts and one of our most promising intellectuals. In *Ariel Dorfman: An Aesthetics of Hope*, she not only gives human form to a poetics and politics of hope, but also offers us a brilliant and compelling narrative of Ariel Dorfman’s work and life, revealing the courage and costs involved in taking risks, embracing civic courage, addressing the suffering of others, and living in a world in which democracy must never be taken for granted. Beautifully written and brilliantly argued, this is a book for everyone who believes that hope is the poetry of politics."'
