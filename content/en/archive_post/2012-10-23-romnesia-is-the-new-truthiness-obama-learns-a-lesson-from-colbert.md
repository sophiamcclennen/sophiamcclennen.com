By now you have probably seen the video where President Obama refers to Romney’s complete forgetting of his previous political stances as “;Romnesia.” Obama supporters are finding this wordplay a breath of fresh air in an election that has seemed to stumble, most notoriously with the first round of Presidential debates. After a relatively dull campaign Obama is getting new energy and new life. And he is doing it by following the example of master wordplay satirist, Stephen Colbert.

In case you missed it, watch video here:

The recent pro-Obama spark started with Romney’s gaffe phrase “;binders full of women” during the second presidential debate &#8212; a phrase Romney used to refer to the difficulty he had finding qualified women to serve in his Massachusetts cabinet. It was meant to reveal his concern for women in the workplace, but it backfired and left many thinking Romney was both sexist and completely unaware of the realities of women today. The phrase virtually exploded across social media and led to a still ongoing series of “;Binders full of women” memes, not the least of which is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/romneybindersfullofwomen?ref=ts&fref=ts" target="_hplink">Facebook page</a> created before the debate had even ended and liked by 250,000 people in its first 24 hours.

Obama caught the wave and followed the “;binders full of women” gaffe by using a smart, funny neologism, Romnesia &#8212; a reference to the idea that Romney cannot even remember his previous policy statements. And the result is a real boost of pro-Obama energy in social media, in public discourse, and in the realm of catchy slang that attracts young voters. Needless to say, the twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=romnesia&src=typd" target="_hplink">#Romnesia</a> is thoroughly viral, and its presence in social media is complementing the “;binders full of women” memes.

Young voters remain the question in this race and, unlike in the 2008 campaign, Obama has yet to thoroughly engage them. Phrases like “;Romnesia” are sure to help him connect with those young voters he so desperately needs to win. And a quick scan through the twitter feed shows that this phrase is having the effect of reminding young voters of the Obama that is hip, cool, smart, and on their side. Even though the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82643.html#.UIM84qu-CeY.twitter" target="_hplink">phrase was first used back in March</a>, it has been Obama’s recent use of it in a speech that launched it to viral status.

While we can’t be sure if the result of Obama using a neologism will serve to bring out the youth vote until the results are in on Election Day, we can be sure that it shows that Obama has finally learned a lesson from Stephen Colbert &#8212; witty neologisms can go a long way to helping you engage and energize your audience. When Colbert launched his show in 2005, he introduced the neologism “;truthiness.”

Maybe Romnesia will be Obama’s truthiness. Either way it is good to see him learning from an expert on how to get young people to think critically and engage with politics.
