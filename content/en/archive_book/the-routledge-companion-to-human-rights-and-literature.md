*The Routledge Companion to Literature and Human Rights* provides a comprehensive, transnational, and interdisciplinary map to this emerging field, offering a broad overview of human rights and literature while providing innovative readings on key topics. The first of its kind, this volume covers essential issues and themes, necessarily crossing disciplines between the social sciences and humanities. Sections cover:

* *subjects,* with pieces on subjectivity, humanity, identity, gender, universality, the particular, the body
* *forms,* visiting the different ways human rights stories are crafted and formed via the literary, the visual, the performative, and the oral
* *contexts,* tracing the development of the literature over time and in relation to specific regions and historical events
* *impacts,* considering the power and limits of human rights literature, rhetoric, and visual culture

Drawn from many different global contexts, the essays offer an ideal introduction for those approaching the study of literature and human rights for the first time, looking for new insights and interdisciplinary perspectives, or interested in new directions for future scholarship.
