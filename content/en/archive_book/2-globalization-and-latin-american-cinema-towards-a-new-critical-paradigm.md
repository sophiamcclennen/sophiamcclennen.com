    Studying the case of Latin American cinema, this book analyzes one of the
    most public - and most exportable- forms of postcolonial national culture to
    argue that millennial era globalization demands entirely new frameworks for
    thinking about the relationship between politics, culture, and economic
    policies. Concerns that globalization would bring the downfall of national
    culture were common in the 1990s as economies across the globe began
    implementing neoliberal, free market policies and abolishing state
    protections for culture industries. Simultaneously, new technologies and the
    increased mobility of people and information caused others to see
    globalization as an era of heightened connectivity and progressive contact.
    Twenty-five years later, we are now able to examine the actual impact of
    globalization on local and regional cultures, especially those of
    postcolonial societies. Tracing the full life-cycle of films and studying
    blockbusters like City of God, Motorcycle Diaries, and Children of Men this
    book argues that neoliberal globalization has created a highly ambivalent
    space for cultural expression, one willing to market against itself as long
    as the stories sell. The result is an innovative and ground-breaking text
    suited to scholars interested in globalization studies, Latin-American
    studies and film studies.
