  The Lawrence and Lynne Brown Democracy Medal, presented by the McCourtney
  Institute for Democracy at Penn State, recognizes outstanding individuals,
  groups, and organizations that produce innovations to further democracy in
  the United States or around the world. The 2020 Brown Democracy Medal
  winner, Srdja Popovic, was a leader in the revolution that brought down the
  Milošević regime in Serbia and he contin-ues to help protestors around the
  world learn effective, sometimes humorous, nonviolent tactics. In 2020, he
  teamed up with Sophia A. McClennen to study the concept of "dilemma
  actions," which offers a structured, strategic approach to fighting back
  against authoritarianism, as well as for defending democracy.
